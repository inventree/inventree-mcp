# InvenTreeMCP

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for InvenTree, exposed as an InvenTree plugin. It lets MCP
clients (Claude, other MCP-aware agents) query InvenTree inventory data over a Streamable HTTP
endpoint.

## Design

Every tool is a thin wrapper around InvenTree's own REST API view classes (see
[`inventree_mcp/proxy.py`](inventree_mcp/proxy.py)), dispatched as the authenticated caller - MCP
requests go through exactly the same permission checks, filtering, and serialization as the regular
REST API. Tool code never queries the Django ORM directly.

Currently read-only, covering parts, stock items/locations, part categories, purchase/sales/return/
build orders (with line items and allocations), companies, contacts, addresses, manufacturer/
supplier parts, BOM items, attachments, parameters, stock tracking history, test results, and
project codes. Once write tools land, the `MCP_READ_ONLY` setting (see Configuration) will block
them by default regardless of the calling user's permissions.

Each tool's `outputSchema` and filter/ordering options are derived live from InvenTree's own
serializers and views (not hand-maintained), so they can't drift as InvenTree evolves. Call
`describe_filters(resource)` to see what's available for a given resource. The set of tools an MCP
client sees is also filtered to what the calling user can actually use - though every call is still
permission-checked in full regardless of what was advertised.

## Setup

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
pip install inventree-mcp
```

(Installation via the InvenTree Plugin Manager UI is not yet supported.)

Then enable the plugin under **Settings > Plugins**, and configure its settings (see
Configuration below).

### 2. Create a token for your MCP client

Create an InvenTree API token for a user with only the roles the client actually needs (e.g.
`part.view`, `stock.view`) - avoid reusing an admin account.

### 3. Configure your MCP client

The endpoint is `<your-inventree-server>/plugin/inventree-mcp/mcp/`, using Streamable HTTP
transport with an `Authorization: Token <token>` header.

For a client that supports remote Streamable HTTP servers directly, add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "inventree": {
      "url": "https://<your-inventree-server>/plugin/inventree-mcp/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Token <your-api-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a client that only supports local (stdio) servers, bridge it with
[`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "inventree": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://<your-inventree-server>/plugin/inventree-mcp/mcp/",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Token <your-api-token>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Under **Settings > Plugin Settings**:

- **Require Authentication** (`REQUIRE_AUTH`, default `True`): reject unauthenticated requests.
  Only disable for local testing.
- **Read Only** (`MCP_READ_ONLY`, default `True`): block all write actions via MCP, regardless of
  the calling user's permissions. A plugin-wide kill switch, independent of per-user roles.

## Authentication

Access follows the calling user's normal InvenTree role assignments. Supported auth methods:

- An InvenTree API token: `Authorization: Token <token>`.
- Basic auth (username/password).
- An OAuth2 bearer token: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. A scoped token (e.g. `r:view:part`)
  narrows access *below* the underlying user's roles - useful for issuing an agent a tightly-scoped
  token without creating a separate low-privilege user.

Session/cookie auth is not supported (not meaningful for a machine client).
